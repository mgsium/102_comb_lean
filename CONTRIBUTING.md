To begin work on a new problem from the book, create a branch called `introX` or `advancedX` (where `X` should be replaced with the problem number), and create a `.lean` file with the same name.

Include the following comment block at the top of each new file, below import statements.

```md
/-!
# Intro/Advanced 1 (pp. 1-2) | [IMO ...]
